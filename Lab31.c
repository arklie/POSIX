 * Turnover time, set the arrival time to the time unit that the process starts.

 * LOGIC:
 * PROCESS COUNTING and REGISTRATION:
 * Take, as input, the number of processes

 * SETTING EACH PROCESSES CONDITIONS:

 * MAIN EXECUTION TICK:

 * Increment time

 *  --> Check if there is a new process getting appended <--
 * > If nextProcess is found to have ARRIVAL_TIME = time and RUNNING = 0
